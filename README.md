# notebooklm_explorations

This is a file repository.

It contains summaries and media files created using [Google's Notebook LM,](https://https://notebooklm.google/) a personalized research assistant.  If you have not tried Notebook LM or a similar AI powered tool, I recommend you check it out. AI is changing how we work. Embrace it, or fall behind! 

I generate these for my runs. I expect most of these will be about cloud-native development, generative AI, or self-improvement.

Happy learning!
